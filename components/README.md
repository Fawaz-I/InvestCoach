# Components Directory

This directory contains reusable React components for the InvestCoach application.

## Structure

Components are organized by feature and functionality:

- **ui/**: Basic UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
- **portfolio/**: Portfolio-related components
- **position/**: Position management components
- **checklist/**: Checklist and evaluation components
- **reports/**: Report generation and display components
- **charts/**: Data visualization components
- **forms/**: Form components for data input

## Guidelines

1. All components should be TypeScript-based with proper type definitions
2. Use Tailwind CSS for styling with custom CSS classes defined in globals.css
3. Components should be reusable and accept props for customization
4. Include proper error handling and loading states
5. Follow the established design system and color scheme

## Future Development

This directory will be expanded in subsequent phases with:

- Dashboard components
- Data visualization charts
- Interactive forms for portfolio and position management
- Real-time data display components
- Mobile-responsive layouts
